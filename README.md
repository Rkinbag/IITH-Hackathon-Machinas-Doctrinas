### Public data - train set
## Problem Statement
that he can defend the castle yet again?
You are given a training dataset containing information about different countries of each
year. The dataset also contains the overall power level of each country given by the column
name “Power level”. Your task is to use this training dataset and build a model which can
predict the power level of each country for the year 2023. Your output will be tested on a
hidden test dataset which contains the actual power level.

**Deliverables:**

1. Participants are required to submit a Python notebook that was used to train and fine-
tune the model using the given dataset.

2. Participants are also required to submit a csv file containing the predictions which will be
tested against a private test dataset.

**Goal**

Your goal is to predict power level of each country in the year 2023. The output should be a
positive real value representing the power level.
Evaluation metric
The output file will be evaluated using mean squared loss against the hidden test dataset.
Final score will be scaled according to the total loss.
